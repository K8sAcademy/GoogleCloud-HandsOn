## Update the config

Let's change the Concurrency value from the default 80 to 100.

Click on the **YAML** tab and then on the **Edit** button. Locate the **containerConcurrency** property and set it to 100.

You get a warning that you need to rename the revision. Remember, a revision (image + config) is immutable. Change the name and a **Save and Deploy New Revision** button will appear.

Click on the **Revisions** tab. Locate the new revision and validate that the Concurrency value is set to 100.
