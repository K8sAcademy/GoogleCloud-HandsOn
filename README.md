### Docker

<img src="https://kubernetesacademy.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Docker-logo-no-text.svg" width=75px>

Learn how to containerize applications with the Docker CLI and Visual Studio Code. Push and pull container images on Docker Hub, a container registry. Learn how to create multi-container applications using Docker Compose.​

### Kubernetes

<img src="https://kubernetesacademy.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kubernetes_logo-wheel.svg" width=75px>

Learn about the Kubernetes architecture and how it works. Run it locally and use the Kubernetes CLI and Visual Studio Code to run, debug and troubleshoot applications and services. Learn about pods and the different workloads available. Configure networking, storage and set liveness and readiness probes.

### App Engine

<img src="https://kubernetesacademy.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/app_engine.png" width=75px>

Deploy and manage single and multiple container applications on App Engine. Perfect for smaller workloads that don't require a full blown orchestration service like Kubernetes.

### Artifact Registry

<img src="https://kubernetesacademy.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/artifact_registry.png" width=75px>

Build, store, secure, scan, and manage container images with Artifact Registry, a fully managed container registry.

### Cloud Run

<img src="https://kubernetesacademy.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cloud_run.png" width=75px>

With Cloud Run, run containers the serverless way without managing servers.

### Compute Engine

<img src="https://kubernetesacademy.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/compute_engine.png" width=75px>

A Compute Engine instance is a virtual machine where you can easily deploy a container.

### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

### Infrastructure as Code

<img src="https://kubernetesacademy.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Terraform_VerticalLogo_Color_RGB.svg" width=75px>

Learn how to use Infrastructure as Code with over 100 minutes of content on Terraform. Deploy an AKS cluster using Terraform, and learn how to use Terraform Cloud.

### Tools and Service Mesh

<img src="https://kubernetesacademy.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tool.svg" width=75px>

Learn how to use Helm to package and deploy applications. Learn about the benefits of using a service mesh by "meshing" and troubleshooting an application using Linkerd.

### Monitoring

<img src="https://kubernetesacademy.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cloud_monitoring.png" width=75px>

Collect, analyze and act on telemetry data gathered from your Kubernetes clusters and containers using the Monitoring and Logging services. Learn also how to use Prometheus and Grafana.

## Description

This technical course covers the core Docker and Kubernetes concepts and guides you to build, deploy and monitor containers on Google Cloud and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Developers, DevOps, SREs and I.T. Pros will learn how to use containers locally and on Google Cloud. You’ll experience several demos and hands-on exercises throughout the course as you learn how to build, deploy and monitor containers on Google Cloud. No coding experience is required for the hands-on activities but you’ll use the terminal, command prompt and VS Code extensively.

You’ll learn about microservices and their use cases. You’ll then learn about containers and Kubenernetes. You’ll learn how to deploy and manage microservices applications packaged in containers locally. This will provide you the essential foundation that you’ll need before heading to the cloud.

Next, it’s all about Kubenernetes on Google Cloud. You’ll apply what you learned previously so that you can deploy, manage and maintain your applications on Google Kubernetes Engine like a ninja!

You’ll learn about 3rd party tools like Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana. How to use dashboards like Lens and K9s. How to configure an Ingress controller and learn the benefits of using a Service Mesh and how to use one.

Finally, you’ll learn about Infrastructure as Code with a complete set of lectures and labs on Terraform. You’ll deploy an AKS cluster using Terraform, and learn how to use Terraform Cloud, the SaaS service from HashiCorp.
